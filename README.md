# book-search-engine
This is a Google Books API search engine that has a GraphQL API on the backend built with Apollo Server. Users submit a search term and it displays a list of books that are relevant to the search

# **Google Books API Search Engine**
This is a Google Books API search engine that uses a combination of React, Bootstrap, and Github Pages. I refactored this application to use MongoDB and Apollo Server from a RESTful API. I meticulously ported the routes and functionality from a RESTful set-up using express to Apollo Server using Mutations and Resolvers to accomplish the same tasks. Users submit a search term and it displays a list of books that are relevant to the search
